MSDOS::Attrib	Version 1.03
Copyright 1996,1997,2007 Christopher J. Madsen

DESCRIPTION
	MSDOS::Attrib allows you to get or set file attributes under
	OS/2 or Windows 95/NT.  These are the standard file attributes
	(read-only, hidden, system, archive, and directory).  If you
	want to access OS/2 extended attributes, use the OS2::ExtAttr
	module.  If you want to access Windows NT security attributes,
	try the Win32::FileSecurity module.

	MSDOS::Attrib was previously known as OS2::Attrib.  I renamed
	it because it now works on Win32 systems as well as OS/2.  To
	upgrade, simply replace "OS2::Attrib" with "MSDOS::Attrib" in
	any programs that use it.

INSTALLATION
        To install this module, run the following commands:

        perl Build.PL
        perl Build
        perl Build test
        perl Build install

	You must be able to compile extensions.

	I have tested MSDOS::Attrib with Perl 5.8.8 under Windows 2000
	with Visual C++ 6 and the README.win32 instructions.  Previous
	versions have been tested with Perl 5.004_01, under OS/2
	with EMX 0.9c and gcc 2.7.2.1, and under Windows NT with
	Visual C++ 5.0 and the README.win32 instructions.  If you find
	that a different compiler does/doesn't work, please let me know.
