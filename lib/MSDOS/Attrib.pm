=head1 NAME

MSDOS::Attrib - Get or set MS-DOS file attributes

=head1 VERSION

This document describes $Id$


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use MSDOS::Attrib qw(get_attribs set_attribs);
  $attribs = get_attribs($path);
  set_attribs($attribs, $path1, $path2, ...);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MSDOS::Attrib provides access to MS-DOS file attributes.  While the
read-only attribute can be handled by C<chmod> and C<stat>, the
hidden, system, and archive attributes cannot.

=over 4

=item $attribs = get_attribs($path)

Returns the attributes of C<$path>, or the empty string if C<$path>
does not exist.  Attributes are returned as a five-character string in
this format: "RHSAD".  Each letter is replaced by an underscore (C<_>)
if the file does not have the corresponding attribute.  (This is the
same format as a 4DOS directory listing.)  The attributes are:

  R  The file is read-only (not writable)
  H  The file is hidden (does not appear in directory listings)
  S  The file is a system file (does not appear in directory listings)
  A  The file needs to be archived (it has changed since last backup)
  D  The file is a directory

=item $count = set_attribs($attribs, $path1, [$path2, ...])

Sets the attributes of C<$path1>, C<$path2>, etc.  You can either
specify the complete set of attributes, or add and subtract attributes
by using C<+> and C<->.  The case and order of the attributes is not
important.  For example, '-s+ra' will remove the system attribute and
add the read-only and archive attributes.  You should not use
whitespace between attributes, although underscores are OK.  See
C<get_attribs> for an explanation of the attribute values.  You cannot
change the directory attribute; if you specify it, it is ignored.
Returns the number of files successfully changed.

=head1 SEE ALSO

The L<OS2::ExtAttr> module provides access to extended attributes under OS/2.

The L<Win32::FileSecurity> module provides access to Discretionary
Access Control Lists under Windows NT.
